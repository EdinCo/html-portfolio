<h2>The list of three best movies</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1. Amanet</h3>
<p>"Amanet" is a film about family life and customs in Bosnia. It can still only be seen in cinemas.</p>
<h3>2. Deset u pola</h3>
<p>Unlike Hollywood films, "Deset u pola" is a film where you cannot predict the events in the film, nor the ending. The film is a story about Sarajevo kebabs and the eternal Sarajevo question: Which kebabs are the best?</p>
<h3>3. Alita - Battle angel</h3>
<p>Alita is a cyber-punk film based on Japanese comics. The film is interesting and it is a metaphor for the struggle for social influence.</p>
